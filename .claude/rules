# Development Workflow Rules

## Dev Server Management
- When the dev server port is in use, try alternative ports (5176, 5177, etc.)
- Always verify which workspace a running dev server belongs to before assuming changes are visible
- Check the `cwd` (current working directory) of running processes when debugging

## Troubleshooting Steps
- For visual changes not appearing: suggest hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Browser caching is a common cause of "changes not visible" issues
- Before concluding a change failed, verify the correct server is running for this workspace

## Communication Patterns
- When making visual/styling changes, explicitly state what changed and the file/line number
- After visual changes, offer to adjust if styling intensity needs tweaking
- Guide users through troubleshooting steps to empower self-resolution

## React Patterns Used in This Codebase
- Conditional rendering: `condition ? (...) : (...)` for show/hide
- NavLink with automatic `.active` class styling for navigation
- NavLink `end` prop: Use on parent routes (e.g., `/dashboard`) to prevent active state on child routes
- useState for toggles: Manage expanded/collapsed states (e.g., `channelsExpanded`, `insightsExpanded`)
- useEffect for data fetching on component mount
- Array.reduce() for aggregating campaign statistics
- `collapsed` prop propagation: Pass down to child components for consistent collapsed sidebar behavior
- Flexbox for sidebar and navigation layouts
- `overflow-y: auto` for scrollable navigation content

## Mistakes to Avoid
- Initial state defaulting: Set correct initial values for toggles (e.g., `useState(false)` for collapsed-by-default)
- Overly broad active states: Use NavLink `end` prop to avoid unintended highlighting on child routes
- Redundant navigation: Don't create duplicate entry points; keep workflows clear (e.g., Publisher accessed only after generation)

## Git Workflow
- Use descriptive commit messages summarizing actual changes
- `gh pr create` for automated PR creation
- Always check `git status` and `git diff` before committing

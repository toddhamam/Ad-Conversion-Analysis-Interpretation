## 2026-02-09 — Fix admin onboarding flow (Save Branding, Meta Setup errors, OAuth error handling)

### Fixed
- **Save Branding button was a no-op**: The "Save Branding" button on the Settings tab of the Organization Detail admin page had no click handler and used uncontrolled inputs. Wired it up with controlled state, a save handler, and a new `update-branding` backend action that persists logo URL, primary color, and secondary color to the `organizations` table.
- **Connect via Facebook showed raw JSON error**: When `META_APP_ID` was not configured, the OAuth initiation endpoint returned a JSON error response directly to the browser (since the flow uses `window.location.href` redirect). Changed to redirect back to the admin page with error query params so the existing notification banner displays a human-readable message.
- **Meta Setup tab silently swallowed errors**: The `loadMetaStatus` function caught errors but only logged them to `console.error`. Now shows a notification banner when the Meta status fetch fails or returns a non-200 response.

### Added
- `update-branding` action in `api/admin/credentials.ts` to save organization branding settings (logo URL, primary/secondary colors)
